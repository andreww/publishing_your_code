# Version control: getting organised

* Almost everybody will use git for this so review that as a starting point. The [Software Capentry git novice 
lession](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/) is a good place to start.
* At some point it's likly that people publishing scientific software will need to help others get up to
speed with git (it is notoriously difficult to learn). For a group with mixed background I wonder if an
approach that will help everybody is to get those with experiance with git to teach those without. Need to 
be able to:
* * Create repository (git init)
* * Add anc commit changes (git add; git commit)
* * View state and history (git status; git log)
* * Remove and rename files (git mv; git rm)
* * Work with remote repository (git push; git pull)
* In any case, a first step is to put your software under version control.
* It is natural to want to "sort out" any pre-existing history in a repository. This is probably something
best avoided.
* Should think about remote repositories and what that means. Come back to licensing  
* Think about how to manage development:
* * git brach
* * merging branches
* Working with others (here or later?)
* * issues
* * pull requests
* Think about adding key stuff to a repository
* * license
* * readme
* * citation file
* * links / pointers to documentation etc
